# Predicting cost of properties NYC

The prediction task is to determine the price of a property in sale in NYC.

We will create our models using real state data  of properties sold in NYC between  September 2016 to September 2017.

The machine learning  algorithms that I used are:

Linear regression.

Ridge regression.

Lasso regression.

Random forest regression.
